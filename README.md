Here you will find the code for the what3words Autosuggest plugin for use on Magento 1 & 2 storefronts.

The plugin allows a store owner to display a 3 word address entry field in their checkout flow, which includes intelligent Autosuggest to aid with entry.
The entered 3 word address can then be saved to the customer's address page and will be displayed during order confirmations and shipping labels.
